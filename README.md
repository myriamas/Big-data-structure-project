# Big Data Structure – Storage Estimator  
*A fully generic NoSQL storage analysis tool with automatic schema inference and GUI application.*

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the ESILV “Big Data Structure” course.  
Its goal is to analyze the impact of NoSQL denormalization strategies (DB1–DB5) on storage cost and sharding distribution.

Instead of only delivering scripts, we implemented a **complete, professional-grade application** capable of:

- Reading any JSON Schema (MongoDB-style JSON Schema).
- Inferring a schema from any JSON sample.
- Computing document size using course rules.
- Estimating entire collection sizes using statistical parameters.
- Evaluating sharding distribution for different keys.
- Providing an intuitive GUI for non-technical users.

The tool is fully portable and can be launched by double-click—no terminal required.
